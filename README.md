## Deprecated

As of TYPO3 v10.2 this package is no longer required, as the factories have been
[merged](https://review.typo3.org/c/Packages/TYPO3.CMS/+/61558) into TYPO3 core.

## Installation

To use this package, install
[bnf/typo3-http-factory](https://packagist.org/packages/bnf/typo3-http-factory)
using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require bnf/typo3-http-factory
```

Note, this is a *pure* composer package â€“ not a full-fledged TYPO3 extension.
This package is intended to be wrapped by other TYPO3 extensions like
[bnf/slim-typo3](https://packagist.org/packages/bnf/slim-typo3)
in order to provide PSR-17 factories in a PSR-7/PSR-15 request handler context.

  <summary>Usage in a custom wrapper extension</summary>

If you want to wrap this packages in an own TYPO3 extension, you need to
specify the interface mappings for the TYPO3 dependency injection containers.

For TYPO3 v8/v9 you may provide configuration for the Extbase ObjectManager in
`ext_localconf.php`:

```
$container = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance(\TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Object\Container\Container::class);
$container->registerImplementation(\Psr\Http\Message\RequestFactoryInterface::class, \Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\RequestFactory::class);
$container->registerImplementation(\Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface::class, \Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\ResponseFactory::class);
$container->registerImplementation(\Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestFactoryInterface::class, \Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\ServerRequestFactory::class);
$container->registerImplementation(\Psr\Http\Message\StreamFactoryInterface::class, \Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\StreamFactory::class);
$container->registerImplementation(\Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileFactoryInterface::class, \Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\UploadedFileFactory::class);
$container->registerImplementation(\Psr\Http\Message\UriFactoryInterface::class, \Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\UriFactory::class);
unset($container);
```


As of TYPO3 v10.0 you may configure the alias map in your extensions
dependency injection configuration `Configuration/Services.yaml`:

```
Psr\Http\Message\RequestFactoryInterface:
  alias: Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\RequestFactory
Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface:
  alias: Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\ResponseFactory
Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestFactoryInterface:
  alias: Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\ServerRequestFactory
Psr\Http\Message\StreamFactoryInterface:
  alias: Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\StreamFactory
Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileFactoryInterface:
  alias: Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\UploadedFileFactory
Psr\Http\Message\UriFactoryInterface:
  alias: Bnf\Typo3HttpFactory\UriFactory
```
